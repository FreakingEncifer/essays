    Day to day plan and my experience dealing with it
    <ol>
        <li>Day 0: Plan for the mission and be prepared for the execution</li>
        <li>Day 1: Started April 20, 2020</li>
        <li>Day 2:</li>
        <li>Day 3:</li>
        <li>Day 4:</li>
        <li>Day 5: Remember the goal. "Waking up 4 AM every single day".
            It's living the dream and knowing that it isn't one goal but a beginning of newer and bigger journey
        </li>
        <li>Day 6:</li>
        <li>Day 7:</li>
        <li>Day 8: 35 minutes late</li>
        <li>Day 9: 20 minutes late. Guilt is your fuel</li>
        <li>Day 10: 10 minutes late. Guilt builds up as I have still not made it on time to studies.</li>
        <li>Day 11: 20 minutes late.</li>
        <li>Day 12: 3 hours 30 minutes late.
            The time rounding off problem kicks in, guilt kicks in and mind plays it's Ace card.
        </li>
        <li>Day 13: 1 hour late.</li>
        <li>Day 14: 5 minutes late. I woke up and wasted a little time.
            But enthusiasm is high that I made it close and looking forward to waking up at 4 AM tomorrow onwards.
            Point to note is that I never really succeeded
        </li>
        <li>Day 15: 35 mins late. But it's 25 mins early wake up time. It feels great to push your limits day by day.
        </li>
        <li>Day 16: 25 mins late. Enthusiastic to find more time. Be cautious of not wasting the extra resource.</li>
        <li>Day 17: 5 mins late. Dismissed the backup alarm. Planned to wake up 03:45 so that Chanting can be started at
            04:00
        </li>
        <li>Day 18: 7 mins late. 7 mins wasted in browsing the phone. Not a very good idea for a fresh mind.
            Need to keep the phone away until noon. Changed alarm to 03:45.
            15 mins are enough to brush and have a quick cold water bath from tomorrow.
        </li>
        <li>Day 19: Right on time. Started Chanting at 04:01. Skipped the bath routine. Realized that I was simply
            enthusiastic about a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>Waking up early so that I have a lot of peaceful time.</li>
                <li>Brahma muhurt is the best time to do your top most priority task.
                    For me, it is to chant the holy names of the Lord.
                </li>
                <li>Time for other activities in life like service, work, family time. Discipline.
                    And at peace without guilt because you have prioritized the most important task daily.
                </li>
                <li>Note that it never occured to me that I cared about being fresh.
                    Keeping a Higher goal in front of you helps in your austerity to achieve it.
                    All glories to Chanting of the Holy Names and to Srila Prabhupada to help me have the correct
                    perspective.
                </li>
                <li>This is not the past 3 weeks of efforts and desires. It took almost about 3 years to bring this.
                    Hope that I don't lose it anytime. I'm grateful towards the wonderful people who inspired me.
                </li>
                <li>Engaging in devotional service. Whatever possible. Be honest and try to help devotees in their
                    mission.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Day 20: On time. I feel that I'm enjoying this. Mainly because I can do my sadhana uncompromisingly.
            I'm no more worried whether I'm tired, because my focus has been shifted to what is more important than
            simply resting.
        </li>
        <li>Day 21: 30 minutes late. Still managed to complete my Chanting by 06:30</li>
        <li>Day 22 and beyond: Have Fun! with your new way of life. Need to continue for 90 days as advised by LMNP. So,
            continuing. 7 mins late. No phone used.
        </li>
        <li>Day 23: 30 mins late. Need to work on diet control. Eating heavy for dinner causes you to sleep more and
            causes lazy Consciousness.
        </li>
        <li>Day 24: 30 mins late. Got a hope that I can wake up without snoozing. Challenge is once you see the time,
            don't compromise on going back. Simple start your morning routine. An extra 5 mins bed turns up to be 30
            mins toll which is not worth it.
        </li>
        <li>Day 25: 2 mins late. Great thoughts! Continuously improving the regulations on sleep time. Trying to
            actively wrap up everything before 21:45 but mostly it overshoots until 22:15-22:30. But because I endeavour
            and continuously remind to wake up early, I'm able to manage. One key improvement is the my mind is
            continuously coordinating in keeping track of tasks at hand and time to effectively finish on or before
            estimated time. I'm also pre-planning tasks previous day to do the next day. Dinner also is planned early so
            that digestion process has completed major part before we go to bed.
        </li>
        <li>Day 26: 2 mins late. Woke up with determination. But I was sleepy while Chanting. Need to work on sleeping
            early at least by 22:00 so that I get sufficient rest. Otherwise also, 22:15-22:30 is not causing trouble as
            of now. If it continues, then hopefully I can make it a habit and use it for my leverage. Also, I think
            because dinner was slightly late, I might have not rested well.
        </li>
        <li>Day 27: 5 mins late. I'm grateful for Srila Prabhupada's grace.</li>
        <li>Day 28: 30 mins late. Food intake during dinner time should be regulated.</li>
        <li>Day 29: 10 mins late. I'm perceiving that heavy food at night is taking toll on my Consciousness to wake up
            in the morning. If I need to sustain the enthusiasm for longer periods I should learn to regulate my dinner
            quantity and time.
        </li>
        <li>Day 30: 30 mins late. Heavy toll on sleep due to sleeping later than 22:00. Need to work on winding up
            things before 21:45. No electronic device usage after 21:30
        </li>
        <li>Day 31: 40 mins late. It is very difficult to learn to wake up with the first ring of alarm. But I could
            feel I could do it. Let me make up my mind and pray. Compile a set of prayers for night and day.
        </li>
        <li>Day 32: 10 mins late. Due to yesterday's lateness, a fear was induced in me. The fear of losing the
            opportunity to chant in Brahma muhurt and also that I may fallback to old routines which would be very bad.
            This fear created a positive decision process to avoid the unimportant tasks and also to avoid actions like
            overeating which result in oversleeping. Hence, regulating my habits. It is wonderful to see how when one
            habit is changed, it cascades into a few more bad ones and help us progress overall. Note that not all bad
            habits are gone, but when you are firmly situated on one good habit, it'll help you overcome others.
            <strong>Power naps -> sleep: Power naps are good but it is a speed breaker in your daily routine.
                Try to be engaged so that you procrastinate your urge to rest and take rest only in the time dedicated
                for it i.e. night time.</strong>
            Also, to give up on any gaming addiction: Remind yourself "There is no real achievement in doing this"
            before and after every game you play. Gradually you would lose taste in playing and realise it is a waste of
            time and you can invest in sublime transformations of your life.
        </li>
        <li>Day 33:
            [ ] Thank you Krishna. Thank you Srilā Prabhupāda for making my Consciousness just right to wake upon time
            even though I had little amount of sleep. About only 4 hours
            [ ] I recommend that this shouldn't happen next time. Plan better. End the meetings sooner. Make a very good
            plan.
            [ ] Thank you Alekhya for all the support you provide. It really helps to stay focussed.
            [ ] I shall compensate the lost sleep time in day time but no point in wasting today's time yesterday.
            [ ] I could already see that the habit is building healthier day by day. Because only with a little push,
            not only I could wake up on time, I came out of bed earlier than most days. This is great progress and I
            pray to the Sweet Lord that I'llnever need to turn back. Dear Srilā Prabhupāda, please bless us so that we
            come closer to your association with each passing day.
        </li>
        <li>Day 34: Need to work writing essays: technical, spiritual. Woke up early. Missed the second alarm and didn't
            even realize when I turned it off. Old habits die hard. But this is not the time to let loose. Regulations.
            Improved response in controlled eating.
        </li>
        <li>Day 35: Got up 45 mins. late. Somehow there is drag between the enthusiasm and Consciousness while waking
            up. Lack of planning and regulation. Work on it.
        </li>
        <li>Day 36: 4.5 hours late. Due to snooze i woke up around 5:15 and now that I was already very late, my mind
            tricked me into the trap of tiredness and I slept until 8:30. Willpower is limited and if not used while we
            have time, we could land in the pit of guilt and exhaustion. It might be very difficult to be fired up
            always and not waste time. We need to be continuously reminded of our goal in life. Chanting finished at
            22:30. Need to remember that Chanting should have the topmost priority daily.
        </li>
        <li>Day 37: 1 hour 30 mins late. But at least a lot better than yesterday. You had dreams that you gave
            priority to rather than waking up on the alarm. Your background mind is filled with random desires and
            thoughts. Need to streamline them by reading Srilā Prabhupāda's books. Do not waste time on videos or on
            scrolling and browsing. You need to work smart and fast. Feelings for and thinking of results slows down the
            process of completion of task. Daydreaming and complaining about the situation also slows down your growth.
            Focus on the task in hand and try to finish it off. Meditate on Srilā Prabhupāda's words in Namamrita to
            help you chant better. Freshen up: 10 mins, Chanting: 150 mins, Washing and cleaning up 10 utensils: 15
            mins, Cooking(Aloo masala sandwich): 50 mins, Eating breakfast: 20 mins, Mobile browsing: 25 mins
            (Absolutely no clue how time flies here), Hang washed clothes: 15 mins, Bathing: 15 mins,
            Updating this: 15 mins.
            Approximately: 315 mins utilized until now @10:36.
        </li>
        <li>Day 38: 20 mins late. Woke up early but feel tired. Need to have a hard cut for sleeping time @2145. So,
            that I get enough rest. Was so tired that I couldn't stay awake for long and instead took a nap of two
            hours. what a waste of time.
        </li>
        <li>Day 39: I feel there are huge waves that are hitting now. 4 hours late again. Slept late due to work. at
            00:00. But I couldn't even make up mind to push myself in the morning. All the alarms were set and still I
            chose to switch off each of them and went back to sleep. Need to strengthen my determination by prayers.
            Only causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada can save me. That is the only way that I can stay afloat amidst all
            these problems. One good thing is I can see positive changes in my other habits. I waste lesser time and
            invest in doing house chores or learning things. I have started brushing my teeth before sleep. I wanted to
            do it from long time but never really happened. But because from past few days, I'm chanting in Brahma
            muhurtam, I can see these sattva-guna changes in me. I'm glad I started this journey. I'll continue on this
            path amongst all the difficulties, not losing hope that there will infinite number days to not break the
            streak of Chanting in Brahma muhurtam. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.
        </li>
        <li>Day 40: 4 hours late. no Chanting done.</li>
        <li>Day 41: 20 mins late. 32 rounds Chanting done. But not of good quality. Better to be consistent.</li>
        <li>Day 42: 4 hours late. Relapse</li>
        <li>Day 43: 4 hours late. Relapse</li>
        <li>Day 44: 3 hours late. Sulk. Take a break to comeback.</li>
