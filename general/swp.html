        <br>
        I hope 21 days broken into 3 sub-goals worked for me.

<div class="info">
    Day to day plan and my experience dealing with it
    <ol>
        <li>Day 0: Plan for the mission and be prepared for the execution</li>
        <li>Day 1: Started April 20, 2020</li>
        <li>Day 2:</li>
        <li>Day 3:</li>
        <li>Day 4:</li>
        <li>Day 5: Remember the goal. "Waking up 4 AM every single day".
            It's living the dream and knowing that it isn't one goal but a beginning of newer and bigger journey
        </li>
        <li>Day 6:</li>
        <li>Day 7:</li>
        <li>Day 8: 35 minutes late</li>
        <li>Day 9: 20 minutes late. Guilt is your fuel</li>
        <li>Day 10: 10 minutes late. Guilt builds up as I have still not made it on time to studies.</li>
        <li>Day 11: 20 minutes late.</li>
        <li>Day 12: 3 hours 30 minutes late.
            The time rounding off problem kicks in, guilt kicks in and mind plays it's Ace card.
        </li>
        <li>Day 13: 1 hour late.</li>
        <li>Day 14: 5 minutes late. I woke up and wasted a little time.
            But enthusiasm is high that I made it close and looking forward to waking up at 4 AM tomorrow onwards.
            Point to note is that I never really succeeded
        </li>
        <li>Day 15: 35 mins late. But it's 25 mins early wake up time. It feels great to push your limits day by day.
        </li>
        <li>Day 16: 25 mins late. Enthusiastic to find more time. Be cautious of not wasting the extra resource.</li>
        <li>Day 17: 5 mins late. Dismissed the backup alarm. Planned to wake up 03:45 so that Chanting can be started at
            04:00
        </li>
        <li>Day 18: 7 mins late. 7 mins wasted in browsing the phone. Not a very good idea for a fresh mind.
            Need to keep the phone away until noon. Changed alarm to 03:45.
            15 mins are enough to brush and have a quick cold water bath from tomorrow.
        </li>
        <li>Day 19: Right on time. Started Chanting at 04:01. Skipped the bath routine. Realized that I was simply
            enthusiastic about a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>Waking up early so that I have a lot of peaceful time.</li>
                <li>Brahma muhurt is the best time to do your top most priority task.
                    For me, it is to chant the holy names of the Lord.
                </li>
                <li>Time for other activities in life like service, work, family time. Discipline.
                    And at peace without guilt because you have prioritized the most important task daily.
                </li>
                <li>Note that it never occured to me that I cared about being fresh.
                    Keeping a Higher goal in front of you helps in your austerity to achieve it.
                    All glories to Chanting of the Holy Names and to Srila Prabhupada to help me have the correct
                    perspective.
                </li>
                <li>This is not the past 3 weeks of efforts and desires. It took almost about 3 years to bring this.
                    Hope that I don't lose it anytime. I'm grateful towards the wonderful people who inspired me.
                </li>
                <li>Engaging in devotional service. Whatever possible. Be honest and try to help devotees in their
                    mission.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Day 20: On time. I feel that I'm enjoying this. Mainly because I can do my sadhana uncompromisingly.
            I'm no more worried whether I'm tired, because my focus has been shifted to what is more important than
            simply resting.
        </li>
        <li>Day 21: 30 minutes late. Still managed to complete my Chanting by 06:30</li>
        <li>Day 22 and beyond: Have Fun! with your new way of life. Need to continue for 90 days as advised by LMNP. So,
            continuing. 7 mins late. No phone used.
        </li>
        <li>Day 23: 30 mins late. Need to work on diet control. Eating heavy for dinner causes you to sleep more and
            causes lazy Consciousness.
        </li>
        <li>Day 24: 30 mins late. Got a hope that I can wake up without snoozing. Challenge is once you see the time,
            don't compromise on going back. Simple start your morning routine. An extra 5 mins bed turns up to be 30
            mins toll which is not worth it.
        </li>
        <li>Day 25: 2 mins late. Great thoughts! Continuously improving the regulations on sleep time. Trying to
            actively wrap up everything before 21:45 but mostly it overshoots until 22:15-22:30. But because I endeavour
            and continuously remind to wake up early, I'm able to manage. One key improvement is the my mind is
            continuously coordinating in keeping track of tasks at hand and time to effectively finish on or before
            estimated time. I'm also pre-planning tasks previous day to do the next day.
