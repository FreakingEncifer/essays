<div class="info">
    Day to day plan and my experience dealing with it
    <ol>
        <li>Day 0: Plan for the mission and be prepared for the execution</li>
        <li>Day 1: </li>
        <li>Day 2: </li>
        <li>Day 3: </li>
        <li>Day 4: </li>
        <li>Day 5: Remember the goal. "Waking up 4 AM every single day".
            It's living the dream and knowing that it isn't one goal but a beginning of newer and bigger journey</li>
        <li>Day 6: </li>
        <li>Day 7: </li>
        <li>Day 8: 35 minutes late</li>
        <li>Day 9: 20 minutes late. Guilt is your fuel</li>
        <li>Day 10: 10 minutes late. Guilt builds up as I have still not made it on time to studies.</li>
        <li>Day 11: 20 minutes late.</li>
        <li>Day 12: 3 hours 30 minutes late.
            The time rounding off problem kicks in, guilt kicks in and mind plays it's Ace card. </li>
        <li>Day 13: 1 hour late.</li>
        <li>Day 14: 5 minutes late. I woke up and wasted a little time.
            But enthusiasm is high that I made it close and looking forward to waking up at 4 AM tomorrow onwards.
            Point to note is that I never really succeeded</li>
        <li>Day 15: 35 mins late. But it's 25 mins early wake up time. It feels great to push your limits day by day.</li>
        <li>Day 16: 25 mins late. Enthusiastic to find more time. Be cautious of not wasting the extra resource.</li>
        <li>Day 17: 5 mins late. Dismissed the backup alarm. Planned to wake up 03:45 so that Chanting can be started at 04:00</li>
        <li>Day 18: 7 mins late. 7 mins wasted in browsing the phone. Not a very good idea for a fresh mind.
            Need to keep the phone away until noon. Changed alarm to 03:45.
            15 mins are enough to brush and have a quick cold water bath from tomorrow.
        </li>
        <li>Day 19: Right on time. Started Chanting at 04:01. Skipped the bath routine. Realized that I was simply enthusiastic about a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>Waking up early so that I have a lot of peaceful time.</li>
                <li>Brahma muhurt is the best time to do your top most priority task.
                    For me, it is to chant the holy names of the Lord.</li>
                <li>Time for other activities in life like service, work, family time. Discipline.
                    And at peace without guilt because you have prioritized the most important task daily.</li>
                <li>Note that it never occured to me that I cared about being fresh.
                    Keeping a Higher goal in front of you helps in your austerity to achieve it.
                    All glories to Chanting of the Holy Names and to Srila Prabhupada to help me have the correct perspective.
                </li>
                <li>This is not the past 3 weeks of efforts and desires. It took almost about 3 years to bring this.
                    Hope that I don't lose it anytime. I'm grateful towards the wonderful people who inspired me.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Day 20: </li>
        <li>Day 21: </li>
        <li>Day 22 and beyond: Have Fun! with your new way of life.</li>
